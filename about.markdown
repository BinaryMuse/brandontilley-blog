title: About Me
---

Howdy! My name is [Michelle Tilley](/contact.html). I love code, games, art, music and nature. I'm a bit of a generalist in many areas, trying to learn as much as I can about everything that catches my interest. My specialty, however, is programming, particularly web applications. Recently, I've done a lot with [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and various client-side frameworks (especially [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)), though I love to dabble with new languages and libraries. Recent favorites include Scala, Elixir, and Clojure.

I live in San Franciso, California. I am employeed at [Minerva](http://www.minervaproject.com/) where I work as a software engineer.
