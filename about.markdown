title: About Me
---

Howdy! My name is [Michelle Tilley](/contact.html). I love code, games, art, music and nature. I'm a bit of a generalist in many areas, trying to learn as much as I can about everything that catches my interest. My specialty, however, is programming, particularly web applications. Recently, I've done a lot with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and various client-side frameworks (especially [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)), though I love to dabble with new languages and libraries. Recent favorites include Elm, Elixir, and Clojure/ClojureScript.

I live in San Francisco, California. I am employed at [GitHub](https://github.com/) where I work as a software engineer on [Atom](https://atom.io/).
