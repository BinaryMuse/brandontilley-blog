I've just released a new JavaScript library called [Planetary.js](http://planetaryjs.com) to build cool interactive globes, like this one:

![Planetary.js: 2013 Earthquakes](/images/planetaryjs-quake.png "Planetary.js: 2013 Earthquakes")

(This is a screenshot of one of the demos; [check it out](http://planetaryjs.com/examples/quake/index.html) on the site.)

Planetary.js is built on a plugin-based architecture, which means it's easy to make it do whatever you want. Out of the box, it has plugins for loading [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) data and drawing the Earth, drawing animated "pings" on the globe, and rotating and zooming the globe with a mouse.

Definitely [check out the web site](http://planetaryjs.com); there are several [cool demos](http://planetaryjs.com/examples/) that you can take a look at, and [the documentation](http://planetaryjs.com/documentation/) will get you up-and-running in no time. Head over to [the download page](http://planetaryjs.com/download/) if you want to get started right away.
