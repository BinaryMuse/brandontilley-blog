I thought I would take a quick moment to preset [GWT-Wizard](http://gwt-wizard.binarymuse.net/), a wizard widget I designed for GWT.

GWT-Wizard is very configurable, allowing you to customize everything about the Wizard--down to creating your own custom view to plug into the widget--but also comes with a set of sane defaults that allow you to get up and running quickly. If you're interested, [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/gwt-wizard). I have a hard time sometimes with over thinking and over planning things, so I'm trying to get code out to the open source community more. The project is still very young, but I'm using the widget in a production system for one of my projects, and I feel the codebase offers enough to be useful now.

If you have any comments or questions, or are using this widget in production somewhere, I'd be very interested to hear about it!
