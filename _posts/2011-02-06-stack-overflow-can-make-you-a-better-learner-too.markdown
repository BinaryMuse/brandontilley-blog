title: Stack Overflow can Make You a Better Learner, Too

Jeff Atwood recently [posted on his blog](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/02/how-to-write-without-writing.html), Coding Horror, about how asking and answering questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), the community-driven programmer question and answer site, can make you a better writer. It's a good read with a good point, and I completely agree. However, over the past few weeks, as I've tried to be more engaged with Stack Overflow by finding questions that I can answer, I've learned something else: Stack Overflow can make you a better *learner*.

I usually only utilize Stack Overflow for asking questions when I feel I've hit a dead-end with Google--when I feel I've exhausted my other options and I [just can't find an answer to the problem I'm having](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2533892/running-a-java-daemon-with-a-gwt-front-end-served-by-embedded-jetty). In that way alone, I feel Stack Overflow has changed the way I look for answers to a problem. I tend to search for longer and in more ways before posting to Stack Overflow.

Recently, though, I've been learning a lot from *answering* questions. That sounds counter-intuitive, I know. How can you answer a question unless you already know the answer? And the answer, of course, is that you find it. That is where I feel Stack Overflow has helped me the most. By finding questions (usually related to topics I'm interested in) that I don't know the answer to and finding the answer, I've learned new ways of finding answers. In particular, I'm much less intimidated than I used to be about [reading source code written by other people](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911191/preventing-paperclip-from-deleting-overwriting-attachments-on-update#4911386), which is an *excellent* way to learn about software.

The other way I feel Stack Overflow has changed the way I think is by exposing me to problems I wouldn't necessarily come up against in my own day-to-day coding. People have a lot of potentially [weird problems](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=weird+problem) on Stack Overflow, and reading them and trying to come up with an answer expands my capabilities in ways that I otherwise would never have happened upon.

So even if the users with thousands of rep and super-detailed answers intimidate you a little, I recommend taking some time each day and trying to answer some questions for people on Stack Overflow. Who knows what you'll learn?
