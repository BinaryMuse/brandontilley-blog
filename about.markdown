title: About Me
---

For some reason, I always find "About Me" pages hard to start. It seems like it really shouldn't be that way; after all, who knows me as well as me? Anyway, my name is [Brandon Tilley](/contact.html), and I'm a 25-year-old geek. My tech interests range from code to online games, crossing art and music somewhere along the way. I tend to try to learn as much as I can about everything I come across, and in the end I know just enough about most things to get me into trouble. However, my specialty is code, particularly web applications. In years past, I wrote a lot of [PHP](http://www.php.net), but recently I've taken to writing a lot of [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and using the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework, which I find fits me very, very well.

I live in Lemoore, California, with my beautiful wife, [Rachel](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=829819055). She is amazingly supportive in all my efforts, and always listens intently when I babble about geek things she doesn't understand. Without her support, I doubt I'd be where I am today. I am employeed [Fresno Pacific University](http://www.fresno.edu) where I work as the Enterprise Applications Engineer. While my primary duties include programming, I end up touching a lot of the different areas of IT on the campus, such as server setup, maintenance, database design, etc. I am also the Co-Founder and Chief Technical Officer for Emerge Labs, the company behind [postEcho](http://postecho.com/).
